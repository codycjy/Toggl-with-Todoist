# Toggl-with-Todoist

## Why this project
This application integrates the strengths of two excellent tools: Toggl and Todoist. While Toggl excels in time tracking, it lacks robust task management features. Conversely, Todoist is great for managing tasks but doesnâ€™t offer time tracking. By combining these two, users can leverage the best of both worlds.

## What can you do with this app
- Start a Toggl time entry directly from a Todoist task.
- View time entry charts by day and by project.
- Use the label map func which allow user add projects in toggl regardless of todoist project limitation.
